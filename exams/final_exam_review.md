Final Exam Review
=================

The final exam will follow the same format as the midterm. There will only be a coding portion. This is to be completed individually on your laptop. You 
may use any notes you have. You may use the internet, but you cannot use any chat or messaging features. A link to download the midterm will be given to 
you at the beginning of the exam. You must upload the completed exam on GitHub in your personal GitHub repo (as you do for the homework).


Review Outline
--------------

  - The test is comprehensive, but will focus mostly on material from the second half of the class (since the midterm).
  - You should know how to solve OLS via MLE or via least squares. 
  - Make sure you know how to set up and estimate models with Maximum Likelihood. For example, how would you estimate the parameter of various distributions, given some sample of observations (e.g. a sample from a Bernoulli or Poisson distribution).
  - Be sure that you know how to perform a likelihood ratio test.
  - On the Bresnehan and Reiss replication assignment, you were asked the following: *Without actually doing it, explain how you would replicate the "Tire Dealers" row of Table 5B.* Be sure that if you were asked to replicate the row of this table, that you could do it.
  - Be prepared to solve some kind of slight variation of the McCall search model or the "cake eating" problem of HW 7.
  - Make sure that you understand the basic concepts of finite-state Markov chains.
