Numpy and Asset Return Calculations
===================================

## Agenda

* Finish "QuantEcon: Introductory Example"
    * ["QuantEcon: â€œAn Introductory Example"](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/python_by_example.html)
    * Make sure everyone can follow along on their laptop (Google Colaboratory)
    * "for" loops, "while" loops, list comprehension, Python lists, random number generators, conditional statements
    * Do exercises 1,5,6
    * For practice, do questions 2, 3, and 4 of "QuantEcon: Introductory example" on your own later.
* Today's lecture will focus on learning the Numpy module. We will work through the lecture part of [QuantEcon: "Numpy"](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/numpy.html)
    * Go over the rest of the QuantEcon Numpy lecture in the Python Crash-course on Saturday.
    * We will not solve the exercises at the end of the Numpy lecture. Instead, we will work through some simple portfolio calculations in [portfolio-calculations.ipynb](./portfolio-calculations.ipynb).
