Numpy
=====

* **Do Before Class:**
    * [Download and install GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
    * Read over the [Numpy lecture on the QuantEcon](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/numpy.html) site.

## Agenda

Today's lecture will focus on learning the Numpy module. Before we start, we will make sure that everyone is able to "clone" the class material from GitHub using Git. This will allow you to keep your local repository up-to-date with changes that I make over the quarter.

**Quick Git Setup**

* Clone class repo from GitHub using GitKraken
    * Demonstrate how updating the repo works. (I'll make a quick test change to the repo during class)
* Quick overview of [GitKraken interface](https://support.gitkraken.com/start-here/interface)
* Create HW repo that we will use in class. (The code for the appropriate link is in the "misc" folder: `misc/setting-up-hw-repo`). 
    * Clone HW repo. Complete practice assignment (`hw-example`), commit the changes, and push commit.

**Intoduction to Numpy**

*  We will work through the lecture part of [QuantEcon: "Numpy"](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/numpy.html)
    * Go over the rest of the QuantEcon Numpy lecture in the Python Crash-course on Saturday.
    * We will not solve the exercises at the end of the Numpy lecture. Instead, we will work through some simple portfolio calculations in [portfolio-calculations.ipynb](./portfolio-calculations.ipynb).
