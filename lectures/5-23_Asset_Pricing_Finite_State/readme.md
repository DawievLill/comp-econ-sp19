Asset Pricing in Finite State Models
====================================

* **Do Before Class:**
    * Read over the [Finite State Markov Chain lecture](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/finite_markov.html) on the QuantEcon site.

 - Finish going over Finite state Markov chains (we won't cover all in class. The rest is up to you to read.)
 - Go over [Asset Pricing I: Finite State Models](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/markov_asset.html) on QuantEcon
