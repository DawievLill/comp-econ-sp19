It models an investor you prefers a portfolio that has higher expected returns and lower variance, *ceteris paribus*. The result of this assumption is that investors (1) choose diversified portfolios and (2) that there exist on a \"mean-variance efficient frontier\" along which investors choose their portfolios. That is, there are some portfolios that consist of some combinations of assets that are strictly dominated by other combinations of assets. This model  formalizes the notion that an investor should not \"put all of his/her eggs in one basket\" as well as  the tradeoff between risk and return.\n",

Also note that Markowitz won the Nobel prize in economics in 1990 for this analysis.)\n",
