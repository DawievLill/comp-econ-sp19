Introduction to R
=================

* **Do Before Class:**
    * Install R and R Studio. 
      * Install R first. You can find the downloads for R here: https://cran.rstudio.com/ If you choose, you may instead install the MRAN version of R. It has some advantages: https://mran.microsoft.com/download
      * You can find the download for R Studio Desktop here (install the free version---this should be version 1.2 or higher): https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download 


## R Basics 

In this lecture, we'll go over some of the basics of the R programming language.

  * Go over basics in these [slides.](./REU_slides_2017_part1.pdf) Most of this should be quick review.
  * Go over our Chipotle assignment from before, but in R. For this, we will use tools in the R ["Tidyverse"](https://www.tidyverse.org/)


Note that I have includes slides and material in this folder beyond what we cover in this session. These are graciously provided by Winnie van Dijk and were used in a previous REU.
