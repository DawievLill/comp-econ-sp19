An Introductory Example
=======================

* **Do Before Class:**
    * [Download and install GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
    * Read over the [Introductory Example lecture on the QuantEcon](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/python_by_example.html) site.

## Agenda

Today's lecture will focus on learning the Numpy module. Before we start, we will make sure that everyone is able to "clone" the class material from GitHub using Git. This will allow you to keep your local repository up-to-date with changes that I make over the quarter.

**Quick Git Setup**

* Be sure to "watch" the class repo to get updates (e.g., from the issue tracker)
* Clone class repo from GitHub using GitKraken
    * Demonstrate how updating the repo works. (I'll make a quick test change to the repo during class)
* Quick overview of [GitKraken interface](https://support.gitkraken.com/start-here/interface)
* Create HW repo that we will use in class. (The code for the appropriate link is in the "misc" folder: `misc/setting-up-hw-repo`). 
    * Clone HW repo. Complete practice assignment `hw-example` (just copy and paste the solutions that I provided), commit the changes, and push commit.

* Finish "QuantEcon: Introductory Example"
    * ["QuantEcon: â€œAn Introductory Example"](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/python_by_example.html)
    * Make sure everyone can follow along on their laptop (Google Colaboratory)
    * "for" loops, "while" loops, list comprehension, Python lists, random number generators, conditional statements
    * Do exercises 1,5,6
    * For practice, do questions 2, 3, and 4 of "QuantEcon: Introductory example" on your own later.
