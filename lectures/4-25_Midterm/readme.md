Midterm
=======

The midterm will be given in class. You'll have the full class period to finish the exam. There will only be a coding portion. This is to be completed individually on your laptop. You may use any notes you have. You may use the internet, but you cannot use any chat or messaging features. A link to download the midterm will be given to you at the beginning of the exam. You must upload the completed exam on GitHub in your personal GitHub repo (as you do for the homework). The exam must be submitted before 4:50 pm.
