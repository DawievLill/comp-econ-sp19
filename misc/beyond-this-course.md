Further Reading Beyond This Course
==================================

This course is meant to serve as an introduction to topics within computational economics. It touches on topics within computer programming, [data science](https://datascience.berkeley.edu/about/what-is-data-science/), [numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis), as well as macro-, micro-economics, and econometrics. With that said, there are a lot of topics within these areas that are beyond the scope of this course but nonetheless interesting. I've compiled a few recommendations here. You might consider choosing one of the books or packages on this long list as a future learning project. Enjoy!


# Useful Python Packages, etc

 - Visualization
   - Here's a good overview of Python visualization libraries: https://www.anaconda.com/python-data-visualization-2018-why-so-many-libraries/
   - [plot.ly](https://plot.ly/) This is a great tool for building interactive visualizations.
 - Dashboards
   - [Dash, by plot.ly](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/Portal/). This is a package useful for building interactive data dashboards. Working as a data scientist in industry, often times the deliverable will be a dashboard like those in the gallery linked previously. Depending on your career goals, this might be something to keep your eye one.
   - [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). This is an R package that works like Dash. Shiny has been around a lot longer than Dash and is quite popular.
 - For those interested in machine learning, check out Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Theano, or Keras.
 - Check out the videos available on YouTube from the [PyData](https://www.youtube.com/user/PyDataTV) or [SciPy](https://www.youtube.com/user/EnthoughtMedia/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=1) conferences.

# Learning R

 - [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
 - [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)
 - [Applied Econometrics with R](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387773162) with accompanying [website](https://eeecon.uibk.ac.at/~zeileis/teaching/AER/)

# Computational Economics

 - [Numerical Methods in Economics](https://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Methods-Economics-MIT-Press/dp/0262100711), by Kenneth Judd
   - This book is considered the bible of numerical methods in economics. This book is most useful for those interested in macroeconomics and those doing work in solving various structural models. It should be a nice resource to complement many of the topics discussed on the QuantEcon website.
 - [Applied Computational Economics and Finance](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Computational-Economics-Finance-Press/dp/0262633094), by Miranda and Fackler. 
   - This book might be a little easier to read. Code is available in Matlab.


# Machine Learning

Expertise in machine learning is an extremely marketable skill right now. Not only is it popular in industry right now, tt's popularity and usefulness has even found its way into academic economics. Whichever path you take, at least some basic knowledge of machine learning is highly recommended.

For those working in machine learning, Python appears to be the most popular programming language. Although there are great packages available in R, C++, Java, Scala, or other languages, Python seems to consistently considered the most popular language for machine learning. With that being said, it is important to become fluent in more than one language. You should definitely consider picking another language and learn the basics.

 - [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291).
   - This book contains examples that take you through the entire process of a machine learning project. The examples are in Python and cover two important and popular machine learning packages. This book is great for those new to machine learning.
 - [The Elements of Statistical Learning, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Statistical-Learning-Prediction-Statistics/dp/0387848576)
   - This book contains more detail on the underlying methodology than the previous one. This book focuses more on the theory. Some might find this book difficult. Also note that the authors have made this book freely available on their website.
 - [An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1461471370/)
   - This book is similar to the previous one, though perhaps a little easier to read. It is a little lighter on the theory. This book contains examples in R.

Often in machine learning, you will be confronted with large amounts of data. Depending on your needs, consider learning a little more about SQL. For some projects, a platform like [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/) might be appropriate.

# Econometrics

Here are a few econometrics textbooks that I find helpful and recommend.

 - [Introduction to Econometrics (3rd ed.), by Stock and Watson](http://a.co/3tqB1aK) A good introduction to econometrics. Many undergraduate introductory econometrics courses use this book. (I assume that most of you have this book already.)

## Applied Microeconomics

For those interested in causal analysis/program evaluation, consider the folling two books.

 - [Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricist's Companion](https://www.mostlyharmlesseconometrics.com/) For economists interested expecially in applied microeconomics, a solid understanding of the topics covered in this book are extremely important. This book is quite accessible, covers many important and well-known papers along with the tools they introduce.
 - [Mastering 'Metrics](http://www.masteringmetrics.com/) This is a slightly more accessible version of the previous book.

For those more interested in a structural approach to microeconomics, discrete choice models are popular. These models are especially popular within
industrial organization. A good book on this topic is the following:

 - [Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Choice-Methods-Simulation-Kenneth/dp/0521747384)

## Graduate Level Econometrics

 - [A Guide to Econometrics, by Peter Kennedy.](http://a.co/dRFPs1R) This is a great econometrics book. It's not a textbook. Rather, it's a guide that provides a lot of of "big-picture" discussion of various econometric procedures. It's a nice companion to another textbook. It has very few equations and rather focuses on discussing the ideas behind different techniques and procedures.
 - [Econometrics, by Fumio Hayashi](http://a.co/5PLTSCx). This is the book that I mentioned that takes the unique pedogogical approach of deriving most common econometric procedures as special cases of the generalized method of moments (GMM). The idea is that if you first learn GMM, then you can learn many other techniques better and quicker by understanding how they can be derived from the fundamental principles in GMM.
 - [Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, by Jeffrey M Wooldridge](http://a.co/4yYpXyn) If you're interested in pursuing graduate school in economics, this is a highly regarded textbook. As the title implies, there is some emphasis on panel data models (which are quite important in many fields).

# Macroeconomics

 - [Recusive Macroeconomic Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Recursive-Macroeconomic-Theory-MIT-Press/dp/0262038668/)
 - [Structural Macroeconometrics (2nd Ed.), by DeJong and Dave](http://a.co/1jBpnV2) I have found this book to be very useful. If you're interested in macroeconomics, this is a nice textbook to read through. Once you learn the theory, this book teaches you how to solve models and then to test them empirically.
